1. In test 3 when the link between 3 and 4 goes down bouncing is experienced
between router 1 and 2. After the links from 0 to 3 and from 2 to 5 go down
the network is split in two causing the algorithm to count to infinity when
forwarding the packet between 1 and 2.

In test 4 after links 2 to 5 and 0 to 3 go down the network is split into 2
and causes the algorithm to count to infinity until the packet is dropped.

2. In test 3 after the link between 3 and 4 goes down the shpr means the
bouncing doesn't happen and also prevents the counting to infinity and the
links from 0 to 3 and 2 to 5 go down.

In test 4 after links 2 to 5 and 0 to 3 go down shpr means the bouncing no
longer occurs.
